# QML-Course
I developed a course on quantum machine learning for École de Technologie Supérieure (Montréal, QC, CA) with [Catalina Albornoz Anzola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalinaalbornoz/). She is the Quantum Community Manager at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai). 

The course is given to students at the end of their bachelor's degree or the beginning of their Master's degree. Prerequisites in linear algebra and introduction to quantum computing or quantum information are needed. 

The course is in French, so the slides are in French but can be translated. [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai) is the primary library during the course. 

## Resources 
Three books are used as primary resources for this first edition of the course (pre-alpha 2024). 
- [Schuld M. & Petruccione F., 2021, Machine Learning with quantum computers, 2nd edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-83098-4)
- [Hidary J. D., 2021, Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach, 2nd edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-83274-2)
- [Combarro E. F. & Gonzàlez-Castillo, 2023, A practical guide to quantum machine learning and Quantum optimization](https://www.packtpub.com/product/a-practical-guide-to-quantum-machine-learning-and-quantum-optimization/9781804613832)
