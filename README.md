# QML-Course
I developed a course on quantum machine learning for École de Technologie Supérieure (Montréal, QC, CA) with [Catalina Albornoz Anzola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalinaalbornoz/). She is the Quantum Community Manager at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai). 

The course is given to students at the end of their bachelor's degree or the beginning of their Master's degree. Prerequisites in linear algebra and introduction to quantum computing or quantum information are needed. The course gave an overview of the field in 2024 and the prerequisites for students interested to develop QML algorithms or applied them on real-world scenarios. 

The course is in French, so the slides are in French but can be translated. [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai) is the primary library during the course. 

## Resources 
Three books are used as primary resources for this first edition of the course (pre-alpha 2024).
