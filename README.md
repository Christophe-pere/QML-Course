# QML-Course
I developped a course on quantum machine learning for École de Technologie Supérieure (Montréal, QC, CA) with [Catalina Albornoz Anzola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalinaalbornoz/). She is the Quantum Community Manager at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai). 

The course is given for students at the end of their bachelor"s degree or beginning of their Master's degree. Prerequisites in linear algebra and introduction to quantum computing or quantum information is needed.
